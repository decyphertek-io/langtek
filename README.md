KIVY RSS Reader in DEV
---------------------
This app is built using Kivy , so it can be cross platform. Build once , deploy everywhere. The purpose of this RSS Feed is to learn spanish by reading. The idea is to have a line by line translation. When I use a free API , it is too slow and crashes the app, it does translate. I am working on getting an offline spanish Dictionary working with Pyglossary. It supports many formats, none seem to be working correctly? It is spanish/spanish , instead of Spanish / English . Also , working on functionality first before features or beauty. Troublebshooting , Work in progress. Expect glitches.
